Sonar Data set (downloaded from Kaggle) has 60 predictor variables (not labelled) and there are two types of classes R and M (Rock and Mine). Problem was to build a svm classifier , tree and random forest with maximum accuracy. The data was split into training and testing set(80 percent and 20 percent) respectively and then the algorithm were applied on training and accuracy of each model was tested on test data.
